Revision notes for brief courses in Empirical Industrial Organisation, Production Function estimation, and Static/Dynamic Discrete Choice.

The notes follow closely material taught by [Steve Bond](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/sites/bond-teaching/) and [Howard Smith](https://sites.google.com/site/howardwilliamsmith/) during the 2018-19 academic year in the Master of Philosophy in Economics at Oxford.  

The notes represent an interpretation of the material. The production function notes were written by me; the notes on discrete choice and industrial organisation were co-authored with Lewis McLean. Please do assume all errors are mine.  The property of the tables and figures reproduced is with the respective owners; feel free to [contact me](gfrt0.github.io) should you want any material removed.
